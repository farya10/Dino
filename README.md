# Run, Dino!
**_The dinosaur is like in Google, only better_** 🦖

> The game was written for the purpose of learning the Python programming language 🐍

> The PyGame library was used to create the game 🎮


> [!NOTE]
> The scenario of the game:
> a dinosaur is running through a desert area towards exciting adventures! On his way there are prickly green cacti that he needs to jump over and not touch! Even with a tail or a paw...😜
>
> At the beginning of the game, Dino is given two lives ❤️. However, during the journey, he can collect and accumulate them (maximum - 5). Crashed into a cactus - minus one life! 🌵
>
> Points are awarded for each jumped cactus 🪙. In one session, that is, before completely exiting the game, you can set a record and then try to improve it! :shipit:
